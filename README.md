# Microbiome diversity protects against pathogens by nutrient blocking

_Diverse gut microbiomes are associated with health benefits, including protection against pathogens. Many mechanisms exist that contribute to this protection, but they are often context-specific. In this project, we used an ecological approach to demonstrate that diversity of the microbiome protects against pathogens by increasing the probability that the microbiome overlaps in nutrient utilization requirements with a gut pathogen that is attempting to colonize. We used this principle, termed nutrient blocking, to correctly predict which communities would be protective against specific pathogens._

## This repository contains:

**PGfam_Overlap_Analysis.R** code to calculate the PGfam overlap between pathogens and defined communities. Overlap scores are correlated with experimental data.

**Community_simulator.R** code to simulate microbial communities and their functional overlap with a focal pathogen

**Experimental data from _in vitro_ experiments** (/data)

**Community annotations from bv-brc [https://www.bv-brc.org]** (/data/annotations/)
